# A-Simple-Search-Engine
Introduction
In this project, you will write a simple program that searches for a string in another string. There are some special searching parameters and details about it will be given in later sections. First, your program will get a string until the word “end” (case-insensitive) is present and then it will ask for a search string. Your program should be able to do multiple searches until the search string “quit” (case-insensitive) is entered. The aim of this project is to practice on string member functions and loops. Of course, you will need to use the topics that we have seen before such as if-else statements and functions, as needed.
